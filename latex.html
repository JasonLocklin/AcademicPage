LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. LaTeX is able to typeset virtually <a href="http://www.tug.org/texshowcase/"  >anything</a> and is simple to <a href="http://saw.uwaterloo.ca/latex/"  >learn</a>. On Linux, <a href="http://kile.sourceforge.net/"  >Kile</a> and <a href="http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~fischer/kbibtex/"  >KBibTeX</a> provide a complete solution for writing papers with LaTeX. On Windows, <a href="http://miktex.org/"  >Miketex</a> is often suggested. <br><br>

    Most people seem to learn LaTeX by using someone else's similar document as a template. I'll post some of my documents here as examples for others to use.

    <td>An example, APA formatted paper.

Document is broken up into two files, one containing most of the formatting overhead, and one containing the content.</td><td><a href="tex/apa/format.tex">format.tex</a>, <a href="tex/apa/content.tex">content.tex</a>, and the <a href="tex/apa/references.bib">Bibtex file</a></td><td><a href="tex/apa/format.pdf">PDF output</a></td></tr>

<a href="http://www.bibtex.org/"  ><img src="images/BibTeX.png" alt="BibTeX"><br><strong>Citation Management</strong></a><br>
BibTeX is integrated with any LaTeX distribution and provides the in-text citation and bibliography management. Like LaTeX source files, the database is a simple text file that can be edited by hand, but I prefer to use <a href="http://jabref.sourceforge.net/" >JabRef</a>, a graphical reference manager. JabRef integrates searching for literature via several databases and manages all the associated pdf files and URLs. A plug-in for JabRef integrates with OpenOffice so you can use the same database for LaTeX documents and standard word-processor files.  Virtually any reference manager and web based literature database can "export" to a BibTeX database, including <a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>, Google Scholar, Refworks, PubMed, etc.
