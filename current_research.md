##Current Research

-   Supervisor: [James
    Danckert](http://www.psychology.uwaterloo.ca/people/faculty/jdancker/)
-   Research Lab: [The Danckert Attention and Action
    Group](http://thedaag.uwaterloo.ca/)
-   The affect of visuomotor updating (Prism glasses, Saccadic
    Adaptation) on perceptual and motor biases, particularly in those
    with Unilateral Neglect.
-   I also maintain a [Lab Wiki](http://reddkros.uwaterloo.ca) which has
    the goal of providing a group "Lab Notebook" that allows sharing of
    information and resources important to graduate students and
    researchers affiliated with our lab, and anyone else who might find
    it useful.
