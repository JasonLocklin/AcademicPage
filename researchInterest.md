## Research Interest
I am interested in the way the brain maintains accurate alignment of 
disperate sensorimotor systems in 3-dimensional space. Object 
localization from the visual perceptual system must be continually 
integrated with attentional deployment and motor systems like eye and 
hand movement. Each time a person interacts with his or her environment, 
small errors are made when integrating these perceptual and effector 
systems. In order to effectively accomplish goals, these errors must be 
minimized. Speed-accuracy tradeoff is a common way the brain 
incorporates more on-line task monitoring to minimize movement error to 
an acceptable level. However, without excellent long-term refinement of 
these multi-sensory mappings, fluid, accurate environmental interaction 
would halt. This is obvious in cases where brain damaged has interferred 
with the ability to maintain this tight integration. For instance, 
Unilateral neglect involves an inability to deploy attentional resources 
to left perceptual space.
