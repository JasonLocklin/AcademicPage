  abstract = {The classic definition of 'pure' optic ataxia suggests that these
	patients' visuomotor impairments are independent of perceptual or
	attentional deficits. More recent work suggests that some patients
	with optic ataxia also have difficulty attending to targets in their
	ataxic field. Thus, an important question is whether these attentional
	deficits might be related to the well-known problems in visuomotor
	control evident in these patients. To investigate this question we
	had controls (N=5) and CF, a patient with optic ataxia in his left
	visual field, perform tasks that required them to detect or reach
	towards targets presented in either central vision, or at different
	target eccentricities in the periphery. As expected, CF was less
	accurate than controls when reaching to targets in his ataxic (left)
	visual field, and was much slower than controls to detect the presence
	of targets in his ataxic field. The reaction times to lift the hand
	in the pointing and the detecting conditions were correlated in the
	ataxic field of patient CF, suggesting a common attentional deficit
	in both tasks. Importantly, although CF was slower to detect targets
	in the ataxic field, and less accurate to reach towards those same
	targets, the two deficits did not follow the same pattern. Specifically,
	only reaching errors in the ataxic field were strongly modulated
	by target eccentricity. These results suggest that dorsal posterior
	parietal lesions results in attention and visuomotor control problems
	in optic ataxia that arise from damage to independent mechanisms.},
