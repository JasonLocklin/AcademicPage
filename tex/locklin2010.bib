  abstract = {Recent concussion research has led to the development of computerized
	test batteries designed to measure working memory and psychomotor
	speed deficits in acute stage post-concussion. These tests lack a
	measure of motor control deficits, which may linger well after other
	symptoms have remitted. For athletes, this may mean returning to
	play while still uncoordinated or neurologically fragile. The present
	research involved the development of a visuomotor pointing task designed
	to induce a speed-accuracy trade off to measure motor planning and
	execution performance in concussed athletes. Data collected using
	this tool were contrasted with CogSport, a commercially available
	computerized test battery designed to assess residual cognitive effects
	of concussion in athletes. Results suggest that a motor task may
	be able to detect long-term effects of concussion not measurable
	with CogSport. If future research can confirm these findings, we
	suggest that a measure of motor control may need to be added to existing
	batteries to improve their sensitivity to long term effects.},
