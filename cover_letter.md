To whom it may concern, 

I am a research scientist with extensive experience in human
cognitive behavioural research and data analysis, 
and I am interested in translating those
skills to applied work. I recently completed a Ph.D. in the Department of
Psychology, at the University of Waterloo, specializing in
Cognitive Neuroscience, and I have a breadth of experience and
skills that makes me an excellent candidate for your consideration. 


To give you an idea of what I have to offer, I have:

*    
    + More than 10 years experience in human-subjects research, 
    including both paid and academic positions.
    +  Experience conducting research with special populations,
	including psychiatric and neurological populations,
	as well as individuals with physical disabilities. 
    + Broad understanding of human factors considerations, from
	cognitive systems, to physiology, biomechanics, and social
	factors.
    + Experience with management of new research projects, including
    ethics committees, collaboration with stakeholders, and
    training and oversight of research assistants.
    +  10 years of experience with deployment of basic and advanced
    statistical analyses using statistical packages like SAS and
    SPSS, and also writing custom Python, R, and Matlab code to
    tackle virtually any data analytic or data-quality assurance
    challenge.
    +  Demonstrated report writing skills, with articles
    published in world-leading scientific journals. 
    +  Reputation for being a motivated collaborator and team member. 
    Approachable and eager to help colleagues
    with technical or other challenges, as well as learn
    from others. I have had the privilege to work with fantastic
    teams both inside and outside the academic laboratory, and
    learned how to interact with others in a professional way, to
    achieve goals while working in the best interest of everyone
    involved.

I would very much enjoy the opportunity to communicate why I would
be a valuable addition to your team, to demonstrate that I am not
only capable, but unrelentingly enthusiastic about making an
effective contribution and helping us achieve something great
together. 
You may contact me via email at jason@locklin.me,
or at (519)772-6931 about potential opportunities at your
organization.

Sincerely,
