	<h2>Free Software in Science</h2>
	<p>Scientists often have extremely specialized needs, so software used in science is often used by small numbers of people. Free Software designed specifically for science is often designed with power, flexibility, and reliability in mind -and often lacks "point-and-click" interfaces. Fortunately, the power and speed advantages of re-usable syntax, and the unique benifits of community development, more than make up for the longer learning curve.</p>
	<p>As a researcher in Behavioural Neuroscience, the following software list is severely biased to my needs. For software applicable to other fields, consider skimming <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianScience"  >Debian Science</a>.</p>
	 
	 
	<dl>
	<dt><strong>Data Collection</strong>
	<dd><a href="http://www.python.org/"  >Python</a>: a dynamic object-oriented programming language that can be used for many kinds of software development. It offers strong support for integration with other languages and tools, comes with extensive standard libraries, and can be learn-ed in a few days.<br><br>
	
	<strong>There are three main Python libraries for creating psychology experiments:</strong><br>
	<a href="http://pyepl.sourceforge.net/"  >PyEPL</a>:a library for coding psychology experiments in Python. It supports presentation of both visual and auditory stimuli, and supports both manual (keyboard/joystick) and sound (microphone) input as responses.<br><br>
	
	<a href="http://www.psychopy.org/"  >Psychopy</a>: an open-source package for creating psychology and psycho-physics stimuli in Python. PsychoPy combines the graphical strengths of OpenGL with the easy Python syntax to give psycho-physics a free and simple stimulus presentation and control package.<br><br>
	
	<a href="http://www.visionegg.org/"  >Vision Egg</a>:a powerful, flexible, and free way to produce stimuli for vision research experiments.<br><br>
	<dt><strong>Data Processing</strong>
	<dd>
	<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/"  >(G)awk</a>: working with data files often requires making changes to various text files based on certain patterns, or extracting data from parts of certain lines while discarding the rest. To write a program to do this in a language such as C or Pascal is a time-consuming inconvenience that may take many lines of code. The job is easy and often requires one line with awk, especially the GNU implementation: gawk.<br><br>
	
	
	
	<dt><strong>Data Analysis/Visualization</strong>
	<dd><a href="http://www.r-project.org/"  >R project</a>: R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. A very basic GUI (similar to SPSS) for R is <a href="http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/"  >R Commander</a>. On linux, try <a href="http://rkward.sourceforge.net/"  >Rkward</a> as a GUI/DE.  Consider reading <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/r/"  ><i>Using R for Psychological Research</i></a>, by William Revelle, or <a href="http://oit.utk.edu/scc/RforSAS&amp;SPSSusers.pdf"  ><i>R for SAS and SPSS Users</i></a>, by Bob Muenchen, for those farmiliar with SPSS syntax.<br><br>
	<a href="http://www.scipy.org/"  >Scipy</a>: A python library for scientific computing (think matlab).<br>	<br>

	<a href="http://www.octave.org/"  >Octave</a>: A programming language for numerical computations that is mostly compatible with matlab source.<br><br>

	<dt><strong>Manuscript Writing</strong>
	<dd><a href="http://www.latex-project.org/"  >LaTeX</a>:a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. LaTeX is able to typeset virtually <a href="http://www.tug.org/texshowcase/"  >anything</a> and is simple to <a href="http://saw.uwaterloo.ca/latex/"  >learn</a>. On Linux, <a href="http://kile.sourceforge.net/"  >Kile</a> and <a href="http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~fischer/kbibtex/"  >KBibTeX</a> provide a complete solution for writing papers with LaTeX. On Windows, <a href="http://miktex.org/"  >Miketex</a> is often suggested. <br><br>
